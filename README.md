# Template-Finder-Website

This website accumulates and provides templates that we use in competitive programming routinely. It also contains follow-up problems and ideas of that particular algorithm. Anyone can contribute to this website.

I have completed this project using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Pug, Node.js, Express, Mongoose and MongoDB.
